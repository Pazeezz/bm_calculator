# bmi_calculator
A Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator is a useful tool that can be created using Python programming language. BMI is a measure of body fat based on a person's height and weight. It is widely used by healthcare professionals to assess the health status of individuals and to identify those who may be at risk of developing certain health conditions.

To create a BMI Calculator using Python, we first need to prompt the user to enter their height and weight. We can use the input() function in Python to get these values from the user. Once we have the user's height and weight, we can calculate their BMI using the formula:

BMI = weight (kg) / height^2 (m)
